Lol... i thought about who else that NEEDS to see this movie. Some =
people have, others haven't, and those others gotta see it! So incast u =
didnt already see an Amish Paradise, here it is:

http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3D7428487200380416428&q=3Damish&h=
l=3Den

Lol its soo funny...  I have seen it exactly 11 times and listened to it =
3 times. Actually im listening to it right now, so make that 4 times. I =
don't know, its just so funny. "I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes =
wanna be like" Change Amlettes to Omlettes. LOL!! Actually i reset it so =
im listening to it 5 times...

My favorite part:
"There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar
Not a single luxury
Like Robinson Caruso
It's as primitave as can be"

They also made a World of Warcraft version: =
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3D6344582916320510051&q=3Damish&h=
l=3Den -- really creative & funny.

ALSO: ALL BFV_No_Gravity are sucessfully uploaded to Google. Just search =
for " BFV " and all 4 are spread throughout the pages.

Here's the lirics i found on a seperate website:
-----------------------------------
As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain
I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
You know, I shun fancy things like electricity
At 4:30 in the morning I'm milkin' cows
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows... fool
And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
But if I finish all of my chores and you finish thine
Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699

We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
I've churned butter once or twice
Living in an Amish paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in an Amish paradise
We sell quilts at discount price
Living in an Amish paradise

A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
I just smiled at him and turned the other cheek
I really don't care, in fact I wish him well
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in hell
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
An Amish with a 'tude? You know that's unheard of
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
And my homies all I agree I look good in black... fool
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years
But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare
We're just technologically impaired

There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar
Not a single luxury
Like Robinson Caruso
It's as primitave as can be

We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
We're just plain and simple guys
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no time for sin and vice
Living in an Amish paradise
We don't fight, we all play nice
Living in an Amish paradise

Hitchin' up the buggy, churnin' lots of butter
Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise another
Think you're really rightous? Think you're pure in heart?
Well, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like
On my knees day and night scorin' points for the afterlife
So don't be vain and don't be whiny
Or else, my brother, I might just have to get medieval on your heinie

We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
We're all crazy Mennonites
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no cops or traffic lights
Living in an Amish paradise
But you'd probably think it bites
Living in an Amish paradise

Yuck
