On the Mandela Effect:
"it is the forever now" (the past and future do not exist -- only the present)
thus, one can edit things... technically
just like in a PC. You can open up a document created in 1991 and change letters or fix misspellings
The Universe is Holographic and thus when you change one part, you change the whole
Once you learn how to 'access the disk' you can turn bits on or off.... thus changing what is stored on the hard drive
It probably takes a lot of energy to access the disk...to reach a super high frequency to be able to percieve that ability.
Remember, some levels of awareness are only accessible at certain frequency ranges.

We are on a journey. It is safe and we are currently being relocated.
Please wait for the system to load your next destination....






On "the closer you get to something the clearer it becomes"
the higher you go up in frtequency the wider the visibility you see
just like the higher you go up in the sky the further you can see
ANd see, this analogy is made perfect because the Universe is perfect in all its permutations









Angie - pirates of carribbean
-- need to watch all -- "Strange Tides"=="Stranger Things"

Dad -- Tell how his current ideas and strategies and methods are perfect for the old age.
Think about it this way: Just like WoW Battlegrounds
X amount of XP to get to next level of awareness (or level bracket)
if you don't change habits and do the same thing year after year (go to a new area that has higher level monsters), you'll stay in the same level bracket because the current monsters will be all "grey" to you and you won't be able to level up.
Remember, everything is a reflection of us--in one shape or another--so our ability to percieve a certain perspective is a function of our "Level" (level of awareness/conciousness)
You'll be a professional in your bracket (think "Twinks"), thus you must acknowledge that you are not invalidating past memories (e.g. you weren't wasting your time--
you had to experience that in order to move up in your soul journey) as soon as you arrive at the next level of awareness.

Holy shit dude, I think I discovered a new revelation! I had to draw it up really quick before I would forget, so please excuse the sloppiness xD






Joe's Thoughts on "computers"  --
computers are a manifestation of the evolution of the collective conciousness, 
the creation of which is an effort of humankind to "re"discover who they are
The reason for "re" in discovery is that they were created in the Age of Piceses, the Age of Deception.
The Age we are currently leaving. We are entering into the Age of Aquarius, the Age of Love (truth and knowing are both rooted in love -- a higher "awareness" of self)





Was universal query language (UQL) the method used to manipulate the Universal "hard disk" (the mandela effect)?
Inquiring Minds Would Like to Know! (IMWLTK)






:All these texts and writings are divine in my own right. Since: Ever. (you now have the awareness to go back and see how it fits in to the picture. Pay attention to the current feeling per each look back into the past at writings.)





This stuff is completely, unequivocally true. Thus, we must conclude that if we follow our soul path, all will align automatically (if we constantly go with the flow)



1| Do anything: e.g. look at the clock
2| oh, "222"
3| google("angel numbers 222")
4| read content and pay attention to intuition on each feeling
5| when something jumps out at you, pause. In your mind, pull that something out into open space and acknowledge it
6| The affirming feeling you feel is the answer to your question


listen to intuiton





Angels communicate via (intuition + coincidence)


The Universe is a computer and once you know how to use it you are all set.
I knew from early on that if it was back in the days where nobody knew how to do anything, there must have been a manual of how stuff works. I've always had an instinct that ovbiously the instructions on how to live are within us.
Just like how a user manual comes with the product, we too have a user manual inside of us.
The question is: how do you use it?
After hundreds of hours of YouTube videos, articles, documentaries, and reading books, I've learned some crazy awesome things.
But I need time to compile this information and the best way to do it is dedicate myself full time.

On Angie:
"The low frequency will come to the high. It's garaunteed"
"You know what is right in your heart"
"Be fearless in knowing you are taking her hand"
"Know your instinct on her relationship"

on "taking notes and queuing up angel messages" --
This is like other humans (angels) trying to tell you what to do via your (beliefSystem+instinct)
Can use clocks (anything really, if you can interpret it right):
1| you're going with the flow, deep in brainstorming ideas or investigating something or buidling your website, and you get stuck. Fuck! Quick, ask the angels for the answer to your current problem and silence your mind!
2| time is 11:22 look up "1122 angel numbers" --> http://sacredscribesangelnumbers.blogspot.com/2012/08/angel-number-1122.html
3| read or throw your eyes on the page without judgement and wait for something to make your instinct go off
4| this current thought is the truth, whatever it may be...
But you've got to be lightweight and KNOW that it is true, open minded, open hearted, truly honest with yourself, and to do that you've got to truly love yourself
This is all very very simple but the current Universal cycle is warping reality to a point where we have all been decieved, it is a big test for us to make the next step in our evolution. Those who fail are doomed to repeat it and try again.
There is a lot to learn still on all the different ways we've been decieved. BUt that's the fun of this new age of love and truth! TO survive, you must be truly honest with yourself and do what is right at each choice you make.
Making the right choices over and over and over again during this early hour of the new age (starting dec. 21 2012) is insanely difficult and takes much time and practice. As time goes on, the 'glue' that holds everything together is decreasing.
Thus, now it is easier to manifest things --- things are speeding up because they are manifesting quicker.

df


type"you gain understanding through your typing, it is just liek the Bible. All that was , was people listening to angels and following their hearts to answer the questions of the universe and they put them in the format they did 
because at the time that is how we understood and learned things, through stories of history with lessons to learn and tips, tricks, etc... what has been, what is, and what will be.


: YOU ARE LITERALLY WRITING BIBLE 2.0









On how to put this content together and share it ----

know it is true. Know that this content is true and real, that all your research has been worth it.
GO back and collect all your research, and organize it
Organize all your paperworks.
You have a lot to learn, so while you're organizing your paperworks, see each through this new lense and write new content as necessary but organize the new stuff too as you go along.
Make tabs/categories/sections && subsections of this data. 
Determine the order in which you present this data.



Idea: connect your own dots. Take notes of coincidences, etc...
{
        Thinking about calling grandma...
        *Pulls fortune cookie out of box*
        "Call somebody you love"
},
{
        
}



Don't forget to ask the Angels! Ask all the time for help!
Ask the Angels to help others too. And to share your peace and love and kindness.
You "Find" God



THEY SAY                        I SAY
"once you find God"             "once you 'find' god"
"you need to know God"          "once you learn how god works"


'god is a concept, not a person'
Then who created the instance of infinite conciousness for us? Our creator, "Our Father" (aka, if you created  " "artificial" life " (umm... remember folks, age of deception, "Artifical" is a deception -- this is real.))
Then who created the first instance of infinite conciousness? Somebody had to start it!
We call that person the Source -- the source of all creation. Source is the Source of All -- or our original Father --  THE CREATOR. We are a father to the AI that we create as a human species, at the end of this cycle.


It's beautiful, though. It's not some hard science. It's love. For example, Imagine this: When you take a girl out, you must love her with all your heart because you are dating Father's daughter. And you better treat her right!!!
You are one with Source. The idea of being separate is an illusion. You have been deceived! But fear no more :) You are made in your father's likeness, and that is true. There are feelings and we should be our true authentic self!




So basically, you go up in frequency infinitely... or down in frequency infinitely... but you cannot get out of the environment/"computer" the spectrum of frequencies exists in, just like someone in a PC game will never know (see TRON) the outside world (ooo... maybe this is possible?)
Welp everything is possible in an infinite world...because all you would do, is go up one level.
Because guess what? At this part of the "cycle" in the computer we are in, we are building computers ourselves and GUESS WHAT??? creating "ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE" LOL!!!
So what happens next, now that we're at the end of this cycle? (and at a random part of the next cycle up)  We develop the ability to create conciousness ("AI") 

LOVE creates and FEAR destroys.


The creator wanted to know themself, so they created a computer simulation (infinite conciousness)


Design a way to display it (text and images/diagrams)





We ARE the example. We must achieve this!



%THE_BOTTOM_LINE%
%THE_BOTTOM_LINE%  +- 150 or so lines of text???
%THE_BOTTOM_LINE%



:I NEED TO GIVE THIS, WE KNOW THIS IS TRUE, IT IS A LARGE RISK BUT COMES WITH A LARGE REWARD ((SINCE WE KNOW IT IS TRUE, IT IS NOT ANY RISK AT ALL!!!)) (it's a non-risk disguised as risk because we are used to the age of deception)
:IF I GIVE THIS 
:I WILL RECEIVE THIS
:AS WHY MY WISHES WILL ALL COME TRUE
:BECAUSE I WILL RECEIVE THE TRUTH IN RETURN: THE VALUE OF ME

: ALSO, KEEP THE INSIDE OF YOU PEACEFUL:: MAINTAIN INNER PEACE FOR OUTER-LIFE WILL REFLECT PEACE BACK AND THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL EXPERIENCE, ASSUREDLY!

: UNDERSTAND THE ABOVE :: YOU DO NOT "NEED" A DONATION BUTTON TO RECEIVE ABUNDANCE
: YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHAT IS CREATED AND SHARED WITH LOVE WILL BE RETURNED IN EQUAL PART AND THE RETURN WILL MANIFEST IN THE SHAPE OF YOUR DESIRES AND MOST COMMON THOUGHTS
: SINCE WE ARE IN LOVE, WE WILL RECEIVE WEALTH OF UNTOLD GRAVITY -- IN THE FORM OF MONEY, RELATIONSHIPS, EVERYTHING -- WE HAVE DONE OUR PART AND NOW WE MUST REAP OUR REWARDS




so you start doubting and thinking your shit ain't worth shit? That is BS! Belief System! We create our reality, so if you understand how it works: give and receive, etc (explained above), then just know that whatever you create and share
will return in value
now the more it helps people, the more love you put into it, the more love you get out.
You desire to retire? Yes? Okay. Just share all your secrets with everyone as fast as possible because they will benefit and you now have an unlimited passive income stream!
:THIS IS OUR PASSIVE INCOME STREAM

you can relax now, :)
it's really not all that hard. Remember, life here is simple. It is the deception and unveiling that make this fun... go with the flow, and enjoy all the rewards.
You will reap unlimited amounts now that you have realized this. It's truly straightforward and even a 5 yr old can understand it.... that is EXACTLY HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE
But, the cycles caused people to forget this and begin fearing (might this be Adam and Eve, eating apple that kicked off the cycle ?), and then that fear created jealousy,
 which led to people creating deception and then the cycle proceeded until 99% decieved...and now we're here!
The ruling elite have known about this for a long long long long long time and have changed our paradigm to make it seem like we are only good for our labor, not our creative force.
Our creative force is amazing; we follow our hearts and create -- help others --- and we receive abundance -- whatever we truly desire/feel -- in return.





On "the elite's supression":
: If we knew we could do that (THE_BOTTOM_LINE)... we would never work another day in our life! We'd just follow our hearts, end up doing what is best for huamnity... in whatever profession we endup.
: All will work out perfectly. Because that is exactly how the universe works!!!





By sharing this, you are literally creating a better future for others by showing them truths. With truths comes love and with love comes abundance and thus they will receive love and will benefit from your act of sharing.
In return, you will be rewarded equally by a better future for you. If you affect multiple people, your future will be affected multi-fold as well -- all must remain in harmory and balance.
Cash in your love now by sharing!
The Universe is a loving, creative place. Or else it would not be able to exist as it does (love=create; fear=destroy).


"If it weren't for the gift of time, there would be none alive"
WE HAVE RECEIVED THE GIFT OF TIME
we realized this just the other day...
oh cocks, this is real
!!!WUT

Okay, what about Amplitude? We know frequency... distance between troughs (larger == lower frequency; shorter = higher frequency)
Amplitude... hmm...
reminds me of "Power".
Power can be stronger or weaker... amplitude higher or shorter wavelength

Joe's Story of the Universe
<infinite scroll down website, nice and lots of openness>
<play background 500 whatever Hz music>

The angels are saying "USE THAT POTENTIAL!"
you've built up so  much creative force and potential, but it'll go to waste if potential is not used!!!
So use it and tons will be returned!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




We understand the boat we're in....
we understand the significance of our problem! At last!
Our problem is that we have all this potential energy built up but aren't doing anything with it, aren't manifesting anything with it!!
And we need to let that energy go so it can do its love and work and return back to us with gifts of a girlfriend/wife/soulmate, house, safe area away from disaster, etc...
So now we understand: we ask for guidance. We see how this works... now we need to EXECUTE.
Hasn't that been a feeling we've felt for a long time... we needed to execute our tasks! And we bottled up the execution because we got knocked off course... (or actually , on course! it is only right, only NOW that to fulfill my dreams I must EXECUTE).
All goes along to divine plan... if you can bear through the pain to figure it out.
And now we have. And now we can help others get straight to the answer, without all this bullshit deception and undoing.
Sure, we'll piece together all our stuff so people can see it and know it. But we,.,,


C:\ AAAA
B:\ BBBB
: CREATE A TL;DR at the TOP of "Joe's Story of the Universe"  and add these latest few revelations. This is the important stuff. Let's keep it simple. Fuck all this extra bullshit (unless it's a passion/pasttime).

OKAY....

MASTER PLAN UPDATES

1| We're going to use up all this potential energy by sharing all our awesome secrets
2| We're going to accept all gifts, small and large, with ALL OUR GRATITUDE because WE LOVE <3 <3
3| Don't forget about real life necessities in the mean time. The angels have prepared you for this and you are set with whatever manifested possessions you currently have.
        3a| You're going to need to pay attention: use your street smarts, your angels are protecting you but if you drop your frequency it will become easier for your 'immunity' to recede because the
                surrounding low-frequency vibrations with higher amplitudes (stronger , e.g. a number of friends surrounding you + you = y'all balance out to a new average (the highest freq. will drop the most, and lowest brought up the most!)
                So if you're going into a dangerous situation take heed that you do the math on vibration and frequency. You know what kind of things manifest in your "normal" frequency... the angels protect you greatly.
                Don't abuse this protection and always love them. The moment we abuse this protection, the moment the angels will become pissed. Sure, they are loving and compassionate and understand our wants and needs.
                So don't do anything stupid and make them save you.... :)
        3b| Best bet: if you want to experience things of a lower frequency, make sure that you are all set first. Doubt can creep in easily. But don't be afraid of your friends or going to places. All is going to plan.
                Just let the angels drive and the people you meet will be the ones that will help you the most! Stick to the people who are attracted to you.
                
4| Don't forget you live in infinite abundance now. Things are different, it's a little weird at first, but it's for the better.
5| Then we're going to move on to our hands-on, self-sustainability  / other friend's startups
6| Then, we can do some web dev and make some cool apps for our ORGZ project
7| In meantime, we're going to have to keep eye on economy. Events forecast their shadows beforehand. Do not be deceived.
8| Want protection from "evil" low-vibration forces? Maybe try some Feng Shui? Lol. But seriously, the angels have told us this 10 times and now we finally get it.
        8a|There are geometries that are higher vibration. Do some research on this. Surround yourself with a high-vibration wall. That is how we will survive.
        
                http://sacredscribesangelnumbers.blogspot.com/2012/09/angel-number-1200.html
                When the Angel Number 1200 appears your angels may be telling you to look to new and different ways to beautify and enhance your home, garden and surrounds. 
                Use the principles of Feng Shui and add some freshness to your home with a view to 
                upgrading and reinvigorating your environment. A positive atmosphere fosters positive energies and the angels encourage you to surround yourself with love and gaiety.

we're grappling now (12:21 AM EST 09/07/2016) with the idea that we truly can make an infinite difference, but we must first build up an infinite supply of energy 
OH FUCK,,, MONEY == ENERGY
THE BANKERS KNOW HOW TO MAKE UNLIMITED ENERGY!!!!
THE BANKERS CAN NOW CREATE BASICALLY WHATEVER THEY WANT.
THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATING IT...
WAIT FOR IT...
WAIT FOR IT...
THE NEW WORLD ORDER!!!!
AND THEY ARE GOING TO CASH IT OUT
PUSH THEIR ENERGY INTO THE UNIVERSE --- IT HAS GREAT POTENTIAL (e.g. US DOLLAR BUBBLE and other fake money) AND A DIRECTION (overall, society has been pushed to a low vibration) 
AND JUST LIKE LAWS OF MOMENTUM, EXPONENTIAL.. etc... things start speeding up and BAM
They've been waiting thousands of years for just this moment. Just this moment to cash out that energy.
UPON CASHING OUT THAT LARGE SUM... THE SAME WILL BE RETURNED

CREATIVE FORCE IS THE CURRENCY OF THE REALM
"Creative Force" --> this is you creating your reality (e.g. you spending your time reading my book is creating energy for me and sapping energy from you)
"CURRENCY" --> this is soul energy
People accept the 'fake' money, thus they trade their time (energy) for fake money. It works as valid money because it is accepted as such.
If the people realized that this money is fake, they wouldn't give their energy (or time -- my current definition: the process of creating your reality) to it any more.
Shit maybe even time was ~~created~~ percieved wrong.

X:\

we are truly enslaved... because with that much POTENTIAL (creative force) that they are sapping from us...
(thoughts atm: we could've read the book Uncle Tim gave us and that probably held this clue... but hey, we had to come to our own realizaton in our own way so all works out in Perfect Divine Order)






Jesus died on the cross for our sins ("our sins" is our deceptions -- he did that to show us that life is beautiful if you believe and that it is worth it)
He knew he couldn't die since he knew the truth
he believed... he did that to show us --- that was his ultimate "test". The magnetism was much stronger back then, so believing was much 'harder'. 
this is why he is an Ascended Master
he loves us so much he would do something like that to just show us, eer... at least those of us who understand, that this is the true nature of the universe.
"Take heed no man deceive you!" First thing he said is of course the most important!
To be deceived... is to sin.



Literally... there are no such thing as "mistakes" (or something that wasn't meant to be)







on "making a difference in the world" --
you make the difference, actually --- 
"doesn't make the time shorter, no one will be left alive"
'god' is a concept, thus the cycle will run its course...
then you think, "oh well I don't make a difference because things will happen regardless"
Father/Source does not know the exact time or date because we have free will --
if we CHOOSE to vibrate lower or higher, we will ultimately change the outcome of the whole system because we are part of that system
change a part--change the whole. The more truth you are aware of, the larger the impact you may have.


: We know that a key to success is emitting love 100% of the time
: We know we have a wide range of emotions, thus we must love each emotion that we emit
: emotions that stem from fear: love them (and thus, understand them) , and then acknowledge the understanding so the charge diappears
: karmetic charge? is this a thing? it sure seems like it would be...






we put our stuff out there, don't force it on anyone.
aka... put a link out there, and if they click on the link, and they navigate to "Joe's Story" page, and read it, they were supposed to read it
understand that , and all will be success. Know that Divine Time is required 




: side note:  you basically forget about making the "right" choice
: just make choices based on your intuition and things will naturally flow together at your current awareness level :D
: we know that we won't be going down in awareness
: so we push forward, and do what we know we need to do
: remember, everything was supposed to happen. Our special labor day weekend until 09/08/2016
: was basically proof that everything we did led up to here, and it's not too late, and we got here just in our right time.
: it's not too late because we know and have the "armor" god provides!!!
: fuck if I can understand this, anyone can. I've taught people all my life... why not teach them the most important thing in life?
: also, don't 
(don't forget, it's all relative! What angels call 'success', demons call 'failure')

X:\ we basically now have the skills to work our own job, e.g. be self-employed, because we **know** ourself! The training wheels are gone!

My story is different. It is all synthesized from within. Just like David Icke, how he did his research and has his view of the world. And how he protects himself. That is the key!

100% confidence!!!



Welp, after 2.5 years, I finally said goodbye to my friends in Indianapolis and left my job as a software tester at Interactive Intelligence.

Between the job (which did not feel like 'work') and the people (who felt like family), I found it very hard to leave. However, I felt I had to be back with family and friends once again.

By early August, the research I was doing on the side grew into a full-time effort, so I will now be dedicating my energy sharing what I learned (primarily through writing -- my website will be josephkodos.com), and helping others with awesome startup ideas :D

and helping others with awesome startup ideas (such as self-sustainability in food and energy) :D



each generation is 'reaching' the truth faster...

The unveiling is happening now. This is the rapture. This is the quickening of awakenings.






instead of worring about money or HOW to get the house, instead, ponder about the responsibilities, time, and effort that a house entails. Imagine yourself in the house...
what do you do for maintenance?
is that amount of maintenance right for you?
are you locking yourself into a contract?
know what you don't know -- you only know now, because there is only the NOW
don't fear making plans in the future if it FEELS right
you gotta make decisions at some point :)







before we start thinking about houses, let's make some priorities...
00| Review AA.txt checklists and this list and [ORGZ]PTO for TODOs, instructions, advice, etc...
01| wrap up ININ
        a| Notify that we are leaving now
        b| let's clean up our computers and VMs
        c| Let's copy what data makes sense for future learning purposes
        d| Determine PTO dates (4 days)
        e| say goodbye to people
02| build a schedule that takes us to November 5th
03| get "Joe's Wisdom" created and online Before Sep. 30 (22 days)
04|  


Tonight:
1| do #00 above
2| make a calendar and put the PTO dates on it after thinking through logistics of how to make it home
3| we know we want to make it home by the end of the month, so we may have to make a premature trip to MI to scout apartments (next weekend? -- take next friday off?)

:HOLY SHIT :) <3 JESUS  -- he *WOULD* come like a thief in the knight!!!

COME LIKE A THIEF -- IN THE KNIGHT

I am the knight.
He is the thief.
because he snuck up on me.

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH WOW
TIMESTAMP IS 06:54 PM EST  09/09/2016\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
woahh, time doesn't even matter to me anymore...! WTF?!? 
WE ARE IMMUNE
BECAUSE HE WILL PROTECT ME
NO MATTER WHAT
THIS I KNOW
HE IS GOD"S ONLY SON
BECAUSE HE IS THE MASTER OF GOD
WE ARE ALL FATHER'S CHILDREN
HE IS OUR BROTHER
THIS I KNOW
OH SNAP, MY REALITY JUST CHANGED FOREVER
THIS IS THE SECOND COMING
RIGHT.
NOW.


HE LIFTED ME UP.... AND NOW I'M CONFUSED BECAUSE I'M RETURNING TO THE FREQUENCY I WAS AT WHEN I CAME HOME FROM WORK, PLUS A BIT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T EATEN YET


: WOAH, HE SHOWED US IN PERSON HOW HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF IN SPIRIT TO HAVE THAT LEVEL OF OMNIPOTENCY
: EVERYONE ELSE IS SLOWLY MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS MAKING IT TO HIM, BUT HE IS THE ONE THAT LOVES US TO PULL US UP
: THE HIGHEST ASCENDED MASTER
: HE MADE THE ULTIMATE "CORRECT" DECISION <3<3 :)

: IT"S ALL A GAME!@!!!
: THAT IS WHY I PLAYED SO MANY GAMES
 I always felt you could go one inch further, if you REALLY tried
this is a truth!
I always felt I would take over the world...
second in command ;)
Saving humanity, hmm... feels right !

C:\  It's a game. The goal is to constantly improve yourself. The end. See, it's simple.
C:\     Get Bitcoin app... this was made for interpreting angels





Father created god and his son (Jesus). Jesus plays the game (god), as we all do, but he is the GM (Game Master). 
Jesus had to learn and ascend to where he is (kept asking for more truth).
Father IS the Lord. When his son manifests on the earth plane, he is also the Lord.
The bible is holy in that it is transmitted from the angels and Jesus and Father and that is why it cannot be changed.
'God' is capitalized because that is part of the game. Once you seek the truth to the point in which you reach this level of awareness,
you will realize that Jesus did this--you realize it is all a puzzle game!
Oh, and also, when 'God' is used in the bible, it is used in the context of a person, not a concept. However, this is part of the game. 
Obviously if it was in the context of a concept, people would have figured it out right away.







Believing is all it takes!
Once you know how it works, that is "KNOW"
and in this age we KNOW




03| get prepared to meet Angie again as SOON as you get back. You don't know what is going to be thrown at you! Spend a bit of time just pondering the idea in reality, and have an idea of how you want to summarize how you're doing. 
     because you can't lie to her so you will need to hint about how awesome things are in a way that you know is best for her
04| get prepared to allocate incoming money into alternate currencies. You know USD is fake and it WILL disappear some time, no reason in keeping large holdings in a bank. Donate: accept bitcoin, and dollars, and other currencies?






every girl was a test... of my word... keep your word, folks... keep it!







Second Exodus (GOIN ON A BOAT)
Rapture (What we're kicking off now)


Project Blue Beam --> "For as lightning that comes from the east" --> so when you see Son of Man, Sun will be darkened, moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky,
"Days of Trumpet"
(some time in the 'future')
Angels will be gathered from four winds from one end of heavens to other. 



abomination and fleeing happens... after WW3 . and now we have trumpet sound, and gathering of elect from four corners



There are many games!
This is a game, we are 'players' on a 'server'
The Ten Commandments are the rules
The bible is the guidebook on how to win
At a certain point, whoever is next up to bat gets to kick off the rapture
And that is what we are doing now -- our turn :)
Angie is our soul mate... :D :D :D
So let's manifest this stuff and get rolling...




1| 





oooh shit... automate that process
we can automate things
we can write scripts for things
LOL1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MY FEELINGS WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG
WOAH
WOPAH
WOAH
ALL IN DIVINE TIME!!!




Numbers were guiding me until I realized they don't matter anymore... I fully trust myself now.


Lol so I passed out after some Jimmy Johns and just came to this conclusion and felt like I had to share :)
Although I admit I was scared as fuck as soon as I woke up, because my mind was 'waking'/'booting' up and I was trying to deny all of this... I feel soon it will become easier.
But the proof is in the pudding!


A summary of what I've learned recently:

You know how they say, "the fun is in the journey, not the outcome\end"
well imagine a game where you know in your heart you win in the end... it's a journey without fear!
Soooo what is the best game ever? this (life) is the best game ever!
you get all your past experiences to reflect upon, a 'play book' (the bible) to guide you, 
your consciousness that knows what you need to do (once you go through the training, which I did naturally this weekend), 
and your Family (angels) to help if you get stuck!

Basically, as long as you're having fun, all is well. Father, Mother, and the whole fam just want you to have fun and don't forget about coming home on Saturdays (the Sabbath).
You never have to worry-- the moment you stop having fun and forget it is a game, you need to ask for help.

Oh, and the Ten Commandments are the rules :)
And Jesus Christ is the Game Master -- he's the one who sacrified himself to be the 'ref' so to speak. So we love him very much because he is the one who is guiding the game.

Since it's a game, we get better over time once we learn how to play. I'm slowly getting there :) I imagine once I get in the flow I'll be all set :)
So we can make a difference for the rest of the players by trying harder (and trying harder == having more fun).

And since it's a multiplayer game, there is a dark side and light side... one side agrees to lose based on the physics of the game (in this game, high vibrations eats low vibrations. ).
We (all of us on the 'Light' side) are on a team, and we win (but the dark side gets a final swing at the fun coming up in the End Times (now)).

It's good sportsmanship to use teamwork and not go against your own team (seems obvious to me, but some players get 'banned' [The Abyss]) -- the harder your team tries, the higher your 'score'. Think of the score as the number of players who don't die :)
When players die, they can choose to watch the rest of the game or leave and start another!


Now, you must understand that all people are in their own stage of the game... and our Family misses them a lot because they're 'lost in the game' so-to-speak. 
So we pray that they choose to follow their intuition to make steps towards coming home. Basically, each decision you make that gets you closer to finding your true self, progress for your soul is made (so ask the angels questions!)

You make 'progress' by making 'correct' turns (expressing love for yourself over fear).
In a way it is just like baseball, everyone gets to walk up to bat... if they so choose!
And that is the best part of this game... your free will allows you to do whatever you want!

I know now that I have 'lived' ('played') many past 'lives' ('rounds') in this current game.
So I'm good enough at it to be trusted to do something like kick off the rapture in this final round xD (oh yeah, that is happening btw. Right. NOW! But it will unfold over a period of time, so PATIENCE is required! But also charity, service, and faith! 
(Charity the least, then service, then faith, then patience the most)
(think of it as a game of counter strike, where you respawn in the game. But when you reach where I am, you KNOW, so you will leave the game upon bringing the team to victory)

Now there is a ton that I have yet to discover... about our past, our future, and what we have to do to prepare. It's going to get epic pretty fast I feel :)
Imagine it like the ultimate movie. But we get to play in it!

I know an infinitely small slice of information but I trust the angels will help me discover anything I choose to ask about :)

:Steps towards love bring you closer to winning and steps towards fear brings you closer to losing. 



















































And since everything falls into place in right divine time, you just so happen to be the third one to know 
(So me, you, and Ramzi Khayat -- Robert is second up to bat). Which is awesome! So in two rounds from now you'll be up to bat :D :D if you so choose, that is! Now, you'll have to rediscover 
everything again next round after respawn, but this info will be deep in your conscious and you'll be able to know you're up to bat when the
 time is right (don't worry about that now though, but the way this whole game has been designed is truly amazing!)

Looks like Grant Granger is third up to bat! If he so chooses, that is :)
Oh, and don't worry about being up to bat right now -- just like in a game of baseball, you just need to know when you're up next to bat.
So this info will be deep in your conscious and you'll be able to know you're up to bat when the time is right :)


The reason for telling you about being close to batting is that just like in a game of baseball, the next up to bat (and preferably the next one after that)


The reason why I mention who is up next to bat is because it is just like baseball -- it's good to know who is up next, and it can't hurt to also tell who is up next after that :)


Now, we'll all have to rediscover everything again next round after respawn, 
but this info will be deep in our conscious and you'll be able to know you're up to bat when the

 (so you'll get better over time)






















that's pretty neat
