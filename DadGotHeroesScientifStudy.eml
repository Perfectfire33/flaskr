Lol replying 30 minutes after u sent this. (Took me 45 min to do =
homework) I had economy =3D 5 min, government =3D 15 min, english =3D 20 =
min biology =3D 5 min! Ezy today!


AP Technology-- The PERFECT class to sleep in! The teacher just dosnt =
care. -- Lol sounds fun... technology is fun too!

Lunch-- Pretty cool.  -- This year we don't have as many people at our =
table, but i sit with my old-time friend John (we used to play Warcraft =
II together, and we both play WoW and Warcraft III) , and a few other =
friends sit by us and we all crack jokes and some days we are laughing =
so hard i dont get to eat much at all lol. But its fun to have a lunch =
period that is fun, besides inside-class moments. Last year our table =
was filled, but we all talked about normal things and fun was "playing =
with food" and i will not comment on that any further.. LOL.

Biology-- ok i guess (sometimes i feel like the dumb one, yet from the =
graded papers i send back, it just isnt so)  -- Lol me too. When the =
teacher asks a question that she wants the whole class to answer, i =
always say something totally different it seems.... but seeing i got a B =
on my test that is exactly not so! (class average =3D C)=20
Amer. History-- The teacher is also the football coach. Nuthing else to =
say. -- Yup. Last year our American History teacher was the football =
coach... consquidence? And I agree --  "Nuthing else to say."

        Alrighty, I told my mom what i told you and she said "Ok." Your =
mom doesn't have to call, my mom knows the times and knows whats going =
on. Just be sure to inform ur mom about what we have planned and tell =
her that everythings OK on this side, and if she wants to call for any =
questions, she can.=20
        Tonight or Tommorrow i will install Company of Heroes and reply =
with a quick summary. I will also attempt on getting the other computer =
to make it work. Anything else i can do to *not waste our time* on =
Friday / Saturday, I have pleanty of time to do it before then, so if =
you have anything in mind please tell me now. Also, if we can, and you =
want to, we could have a game night at Bill's playing risk. (Normal =
risk, lol) That is, if he is even home (hes got band every day) and his =
dad can play. Chances are about 35%.=20

^^^^^^^ You don't have to read this part all at once. Please don't if =

+++The following is a scientific approach to typing paragraphs to which =
I am undergoing.+++=20
___The written information is 100% relevent to the topic above =3D =

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=

----------------------------------------------------------------


    Just thought i'd inform you of what *might* occur. Because it's =
friday, and if Bill and Roo have nothing to do, they probably will be =
over. And when Bill comes over, he doesn't want to spend the whole time =
on the computer, especially on a game that only 1-2 computers can play, =
so he'll prolly ask us to come over for a game night, or possibly to do =
something outside. {(at his house/grandma's)(something we can all enjoy =
together.)} Roo however, will do anything we do. (I figured that out on =
a scientific study period of 2 years, LOL)

    If you haven't figured this out already, my results of what happens =
on a usual basis is stated in the above paragraph. These are not 100% =
accurate, but i concur that they are atleast 80% accurate. So don't be =
surprised of whatever Bill asks, and don't worry about Roo if he comes =
over because he doesn't seem care. My friends are very *interesting* to =
study, arent they, lol? This is because they have no set schedule. (I =
don't have a set schedule either) And once they ask what *i am doing =
this weekend* and i say *Josh is coming over* their priorities shift =
instantly to *coming over here*. It's just what they do... a habit. =
Nothing I can do about it, just thought i'd share my scientific =
results!!


OK if you have read ALL of that, i am doing another Scientific Study: =
This one is based on if:
1.) coloring text.
2.) bold, italic, and underlining text.
3.) Mixture of both
Will #1 and #2, possibly #3 help you read sentences faster in large =
paragraphs? Such as the ones above? If so, good. If not, then i will no =
longer try and make important words, phrases, and ideas *stick out*.

Just wondering, because reading "WALLS of TEXT" isnt always fun. =
Sometimes it hurts the eyes, and reading JUST the FORMATTED text is =
easiest. Lol, i need to tell my Biology teacher i am conducting a "Lab =
Report!" lol. However, it may NOT be helpful, if using MANY forms of =
formatted text, and it may be better using only [BOLD] or [UNDERLINE] =
(as examples) is best.

So, when you get the time, please read all of this and reply on what =
your opinion is on this. I'd like to know. It took me exactly 35 minutes =
to type this, because i took careful measures to try and make each piece =
of formatted text stand out properly.
        You don't have to read it all at once. Please don't if its =
hurting your eyes!

  ok I am sending this back 10 minutes after u sent it to me. My mom is =
at church at the moment, and she probally wont want to call but i'll =
try. ok so that gives me aprox. 45 minutes to get any homework done ( =
not that i get much on fridays) ok. my teachers are as follows:

  *Biology-- ok i guess (sometimes i feel like the dumb one, yet from =
the graded papers i send back, it just isnt so)
  *English-- more like literature,since we just read. The teacher is =
like "I'M GONNA KILL YOU ALL !!! Oh nice work, Katrina!"
  *Spanish-- fine! the teacher is like in her 20s and she talks really =
fast. (i have to be called by my Spanish name "Jose" (hoe-say))
  *AP Technology-- The PERFECT class to sleep in! The teacher just dosnt =
care.
  *Lunch-- Pretty cool. I sit next to my Polish friend Darius. =
Seriously, he is from Poland! He is just learning his English and I was =
assigned by the principle (because I'm a "good kid") to sit next to him =
at lunch. Pretty cool, huh?
  *Amer. History-- The teacher is also the football coach. Nuthing else =

  *Geometery-- The teacher talks really slow and just goes on and on. =
but we manage to get stuff done.

it made no sense. So I suppose everyone has their own methods on writing =

learn it a bit, and test it out on both computers (if possible).=20
            Recently (for 1.5 weeks) i've been working on a Warcraft III =
Tower Defense map. By Thursday it should be FINALLY complete. (At least =
the main part) The math of making those triggers work is harder than =
Advanced Algebra that we are learning in school... so thats why i go to =
others on the internet to get help lol. Im not sure if u've played a TD =
(TD =3D Tower Defense), but its where enemies spawn in a location and =
run a path and if they reach the center, something bad happens. =
(Normally you have 10 lives and you lose 1 for each enemy that enters =
the center) You build towers and have to kill the enemies before they =
reach the center. Well it seems easy to make but its not. Especially if =
you do it from scratch, it takes me on average 2 weeks of hard work and =
triggering to make a map, and then a week of having people test it... =
and then finally getting people to actually play it! So if i can get it =
done by friday i can show u how to play and we can try to win it. Its =
gunna be hard though... im advertising it as one of the *Hardest TDs =
Ever* =3D) Oh well, gotta go get some sleep, school comes early lol.

          Cool!!!! Ya that is the game I told u about! It's really cool! =
go on google video and type in "Company of heroes" then scroll through =
the movies until u find sumthin that has "tutorial" in the name, and it =
shows u a guy playing through the tutorial of the game. this way u can =
play the game right away instead of going through a dull but =
informational tutorial. u might want to do the tutorial anyways to get =
used to the controls, but it wouldn't hurt to watch it before. (it might =
give u the heads up or sumthing) also go on IGN PC and look at it too. =
They got tons of good-to-know stuff.

            Hey Josh!

            On Saturday my dad and I went to Sports Authority to get me =
some new break cables. After that, my dad wanted to go to Target and see =
if there was anything he "needed" there, and there was this game called =
"Company of Heroes" that he decided to get. Now I remember you telling =
me something about a game with the name *Company* in it, so after a few =
moments of reading the box I discovered that *Thats that game that Josh =
told me about!!* So we got Company of Heroes, but im going to wait for u =
to come over to try it out. Since its an RTS, it sounds interesting.=20

            Right now as I read the box i am finding that the Recommened =

Nearby Computer Has:

            -Windows XP or Vista                                         =
                        Windows XP                                       =
 Windows XP
            -3.0 Ghz Pentium IV or AMD Anthlon XP  Processor             =
       2.01 Ghz (64 Bit)                                  1.75 Ghz (32 =
Bit)
            -1GB RAM                                                     =
                               1GB of RAM                                =
        1GB of RAM
            -256MB Nvidia GeForce 6800 Series or better Video Card       =
          128MB Nvidia GeForce 6600                128 MB Nvidia GeForce =
5600

            So as you can see im worried about not just that computer =
next to me can do, my computer is on the line too. Processor speed is =
OK, (for me) but RAM is required 1gig, and we got 1gig, but really you =
should have like double the ram required. (1.5 gig-2gig) And our video =
cards aren't even 1/2 of what is required, 128 MB vs. 256 -- 6600 vs. =
6800? SO i guess we'll be running on LOWEST graphics =3D(

            However, this is a great excuse to get my dad to get us more =
memory and better video cards =3D)

            So just thought i'd throw some good (and bad) news out to =
ya. By the way, whens the next time u can come over? I am keeping up the =
DTS* K`nex  for you to see. Its pretty neat. It includes an elevator, =
ramp, 3 stories, and takes up most of the room!

            Cya later,=20
