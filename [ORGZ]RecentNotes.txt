        A| Build a dashboard of stuff that we need to keep track of and don't want to remember: let's make sure we don't burn ourselves (taxes, etc...)!!
                a| identify what ORGZ files we want to keep up to date. Let's minimize the amount of stuff we need to update: we only want to see what we need to know, not what might be cool to know (there are other more fun things to be spending our energy on!!)
