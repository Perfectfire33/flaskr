HEY!!

        Last weekend i was looking over my CotRD (Clan of the Red =
Dragon) guild website, and while reading the forums someone gave a =
website link to a RPG game. I thought, "might as well see if its any =
good" because i was in the need of a break from Battlefield Vietnam & 2. =
And it is, in my opinion, a great game -- with a few bugs.=20

The website link below:
LEGEND OF ARES

Here are the good points:

-A massively multiplayer online role-playing game. :MMORPG:
-A great alternative from Runescape, with Awesome Graphics!
-Almost like World of Warcraft, same style of gameplay.
-Multiple different camera views & angles.
-Many zones, and hundreds of monsters.
-Good Storyline, but not required to play the game. (i think)
-Guilds, Parties, Friends, Whisper, General Chat, and many other ways of =
communicating.
-Easy to learn interface.
-

My review: 9.5 / 10
