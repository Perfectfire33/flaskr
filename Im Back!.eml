Hey, haha nice smilies.

Im back, just unloaded about 15 Avon boxes of stuff and still unloading. =
(I took a break and turned on my computer to check my e-mail) Still got =
lots to do, gotta cut the front & back grass and undo all the automatic =
watering systems. It will take a few hours for the house to air out =
after being closed up for 10 days. By Saturday everything will be back =
to normal i think. Now, i will give an account for each day we were =
camping. Day 1-10, Morning-Afternoon-Evening, What we did, what we ate, =
where we went. Background info about each park, and anything else i can =
remember.

Day 1:    Leaving the house ---> Hartwick Pines State Park, a few miles =
south of Gaylord.
-----------------------------
    Waking up around 10:00 AM, we left the house for Terry's Tarrence =
for breakfast. Like always, Mother complained about the coffee. Then, we =
came back home and got last-minute packing done and left, around 12:00. =
We skipped lunch, only having a few snacks and arrived at our =
destination around 3:30. Then, we ate grilled cheese at the campground. =
That day was very hot, and i would bet it hit past 90 degrees around =
evening. So, we didn't do much, besides the fact that at Hartwick we =
don't do much in the first place.
    Hartwick Pines State Park is located south of Gaylord and north of =
Grayling. It is a part of the 1800's logging country, and the whole area =
is pretty much clear-cutted. The second growth forest has some larger =
trees, but for the most part its saplings. There is a logging meusem, =
and an small area of the old-growth forest that survived that is =
protected and tours go through. There are two small lakes, connected by =
a 3 foot wide-6 inch deep stream. Bright and Glory are the names, Glory =
is 47 feet deep at the center and is double the size of Bright lake, =
which is 35 feet deep. They are kettle lakes, formed by the Wisconsin =
Glacier 10,000 years ago. The DNR stocks the lakes each spring with 500 =
trout, fed with sweetcorn. The park covers approximatetly 15 square =
miles of land.
    Hartwick supplies Full-Hookup, (Sewage dumping, water supply, and =
electricity on site) and that is why we stop there every year twice, =
once on the way up and once on the way down, to dump and flush the =
tanks. Camp Grayling National Guard Military Reservation sorrounds the =
eastern and southern sides, the bombs they test-drop always sound like =
thunder. It has never failed to rain, or at least look stormy at =
Hartwick when we visit too. If i can remember correctly, it cost us 33$ =
for one night.
